# Text Toxicity Classification

This project aims to develop a text toxicity classification model using TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Gradio. The inspiration for this project was drawn from the Kaggle competition called [Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge).

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to create a model capable of identifying and classifying toxic comments in text. The Kaggle competition provides a challenging and diverse dataset, offering a valuable opportunity to develop skills in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning model construction.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from the aforementioned competition. It consists of a variety of comments labeled as toxic or non-toxic. The challenge is to create a model that generalizes well to identify toxicity patterns in different types of text.

## Technologies Used
- **TensorFlow:** Used for building and training machine learning models.
- **NumPy:** Employed for efficient array manipulation and mathematical operations.
- **Pandas:** Used for tabular data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** Utilized for data visualization and result representation.
- **Gradio:** Adopted to create interactive interfaces for model evaluation.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- **data:** Contains training and testing datasets.
- **notebook:** Includes Jupyter notebook with exploratory data analysis and model development.
- **toxicity.h5:** Stores the trained model.

## Results
The model results, along with visualizations and performance metrics, can be accessed from the pre-trained model file named toxicity.h5 in the project's root.
