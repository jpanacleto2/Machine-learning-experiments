# PyTorch Leaf Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on leaf classification using PyTorch, a deep learning framework. The goal is to develop a neural network that can accurately classify different types of leaves based on provided images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/plant-disease-recognition-dataset). It consists of labeled images of leaves, making it suitable for training and evaluating the classification model.

# Model

The neural network architecture is a simple CNN designed for image classification. Modify the architecture as needed.
