# Machine/Deep Learning Experiments

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the study of machine learning and deep learning concepts. Here, you will find a collection of experiments and studies covering various aspects of these exciting fields.

## Structure

### 1. Experiments
In the [Experiments](https://github.com/jpanacleto2/Portfolio/tree/master/Experiments) folder, you'll discover practical experiments that I have developed to explore and apply machine learning and deep learning techniques. Each experiment is designed to provide hands-on experience and insights into specific concepts.

### 2. Studies
The [Studies](https://github.com/jpanacleto2/Portfolio/tree/master/Studies) folder is organized into three subfolders, each focusing on a distinct area of interest:

#### - NLP (Natural Language Processing)
The [Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://github.com/jpanacleto2/Portfolio/tree/master/Studies/NLP) folder includes studies such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and language modeling to gain a deeper understanding of language processing techniques.

#### - PyTorch
The [PyTorch](https://github.com/jpanacleto2/Portfolio/tree/master/Studies/Pytroch) folder contains notebooks dedicated to mastering this powerful deep learning framework. Delve into the PyTorch library to understand its syntax, build neural networks, and explore various deep learning concepts.

#### - TensorFlow & Keras
The [TensorFlowKeras](https://github.com/jpanacleto2/Portfolio/tree/master/Studies/Tensorflow_Keras) folder houses studies that showcase the versatility and capabilities of these popular frameworks. Discover the TensorFlow and Keras ecosystems for building and training machine learning and deep learning models.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the content in each folder. The experiments offer hands-on coding experiences, while the studies provide a more in-depth exploration of specific topics. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to provide valuable insights and practical knowledge.
